# SPAM-SMS-DETECTION

Interpretation of Metrics
Naive Bayes (NB)
Achieves high precision for both ham (97.90%) and spam (92.80%), demonstrating accurate classification. Balanced recall and F-score (92.90%, 97.90%, and 95.30%) indicate effective identification of instances in both classes.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Shows moderate precision for ham (83.20%) and spam (82.60%), with balanced recall and F-score (83.80%, 82.10%, and 82.40%) reflecting a fair trade-off between precision and recall.

Logistic Regression (LR)

Exhibits high precision for both ham (97.50%) and spam (99.30%), along with balanced recall and F-score (99.40%, 97.20%, and 98.30%), showcasing accurate and well-rounded classification.

Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

Achieves high precision for ham (90.10%) and perfect precision for spam (100.00%), indicating low false positive rates. High recall for ham (100.00%) and moderate recall for spam (88.30%) result in balanced F-scores (94.80% and 93.80%), showcasing robust performance in both classes.

Suggestion for Final Model:

Considering the high precision and well-balanced performance, Logistic Regression (LR) emerges as a strong candidate for the final model, demonstrating accurate classification across both ham and spam instances.
